## [v1.0.0](https://github.com/mrWh1te/Botmation/releases/tag/1.0.0) @botmation/*

This release includes a repo refactor, to rely on the amazing [Nx](https://nx.dev) tool to manage the "neighborhood" of applications ("houses") and libraries ("house parts") that Botmation consists of.

- [@botmation/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@botmation/core)
- [@botmation/instagram](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@botmation/instagram)

[@botmation/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@botmation/core) v1.0.0 is a re-release of [botmation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/botmation) v3.0.0

If these out-of-order Github Tags confuse, please accept our apologies. The Tags were originally associated with the [botmation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/botmation) npm package, but now refer to all published npm packages under the new [@botmation](https://www.npmjs.com/org/botmation) organization.

The Github Tags will be updated on major API breaking changes, following [semantic versioning](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-semantic-versioning). Therefore these tagged Github releases will begin skipping minor and patch updates.
