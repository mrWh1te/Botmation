# @botmation/core

The primary [Botmation](https://botmation.dev) package for building bots.

# Introduction

[Botmation](https://botmation.dev) is simple declarative framework for building bots in TypeScript using [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer). It follows a simple, composable pattern focused on a single type of function called a BotAction. 

BotActions do everything, from simple tasks in crawling and scraping the web, to logging in & automating social media. They are composable, so they are easily assembled.

The possibilities are endless!

> “Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.” - Albert Einstein

Why choose Botmation?

It empowers Puppeteer code with a simple pattern to maximize code readability, reusability and testability.

Its compositional design comes pre-built with safe defaults for building bots with less code.

It encourages a learn at your own pace approach to exploring the possibilities of Functional programming.

It has 100% source code test coverage.

# Getting Started

Botmation is a NodeJS library written in TypeScript. You'll need [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) LTS installed and the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) installed globally (or have a transpiling code step).

Install
-------

To get started, install Botmation's main package with `npm`:

    npm install --save @botmation/core

If you're just getting started, install `puppeteer`:

    npm install --save puppeteer 

You can install any other [@botmation packages](https://www.npmjs.com/org/botmation) to extend upon the available functionality:

    npm install --save @botmation/instagram

Documentation

For getting started, API docs of *all* packages with examples, visit [Botmation's Documentation](https://botmation.dev/).

Library Reference
-----------------

`@botmation/core` is the main package used every-time. It has the foundational functions for building bots. Other packages, like `@botmation/instagram` have specific functions that work with the main ones from Core.

After intalling through `npm`, import functions from their respective packages:
```javascript
import { chain, goTo, screenshot } from '@botmation/core'
import { login } from '@botmation/instagram'
```

`@botmation/core` v1 has 14 groups of `BotAction` to choose from:
