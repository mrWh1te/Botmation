/**
 * @future support piping in the `collection`
 * @description   A forEach method to loop a collection (array or object's key/value pairs) with assembled Actions in a pipe
 *
 *                Special Action that can take an array of stuff or an object of key value pairs (dictionary)
 *                to iterate over while applying the closure (ActionOrActionsFactory) as provided
 *                The closure's purpose is simply to return a Action or Action[]
 *
 *                The collection can be passed in via higher-order param or as Pipe value. If both are provided, higher-order param is used.
 *
 *                The callback's returned Action(s) are called with the three params matching the forEach() callback syntax
 *                  value, index, array
 *
 *                Since this function supports Dictionaries too, the "index" is casted into a string
 *                  value, key, collection
 *
 *                When the returned Action(s) are ran in a Pipe, the same callback params are wrapped in an array then injected as the Pipe object's value
 *                  [value, key, collection]
 *
 *                The original use-case for this concept, was to be able to re-apply a script on multiple websites via a loop
 *                I've seen multiple examples online, of people using Puppeteer to write a script of actions then loop through a list of websites
 *                  to apply the same sequence of actions on each
 *
 * @example    with an array as the collection
 *  forAll(['google.com', 'facebook.com'])(
 *    (siteName) => ([ // you can name the variable whatever you want in the closure
 *      goTo('http://' + siteName),
 *      screenshot(siteName + '-homepage') // then re-use it in your Action setup
 *    ])
 *  )
 *
 * @example    with a dictionary as the collection, we can iterate key/value pairs in our Action's setup ie fill a form with keys being form input selectors and values being what its typed in each
 *  forAll({id: 'google.com', someOtherKey: 'apple.com'})(
 *    (siteName, key) => ([
 *      goTo('http://' + siteName)
 *      screenshot(key + siteName + '-homepage')
 *    ])
 *  )
 *
 * @example   a 1 action script example
 *  forAll(['google.com'])(
 *    (siteName) => goTo('http://' + siteName)
 *  )
