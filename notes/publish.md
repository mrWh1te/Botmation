# Publishing Packages

Libraries `core`, `instagram` and `linkedin` can be built and published.

Publishing isn't fully automated.

## Prep dist

After building, i.e.:

```bash
nx build core
```

Go into the dist directory of the library built and update the `package.json` file accordingly:

### Core

### Instagram

### LinkedIn
