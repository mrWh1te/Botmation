# Publishing Packages

Libraries `core`, `instagram` and `linkedin` can be built and published.

Publishing isn't fully automated.

## Prep dist

Step 1. Build the package i.e. `core`

```bash
nx build core --with-deps
```

Step 2. Terminal into dist directory of built package

Step 3. Tweaks

Go into the dist directory of the library built and update the `package.json` file accordingly:

### Core

### Instagram

### LinkedIn
