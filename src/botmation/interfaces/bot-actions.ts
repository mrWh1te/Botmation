/**
 * @description    All BotAction Interfaces
 *                 This project is centered on async functions called BotAction's
 * 
 *                 The base interface for a `BotAction` is below
 * 
 *                 There are higher order functions that return `BotAction`'s called `BotActionFactory`'ies
 * 
 *                 The default nature of a BotAction (without having specific generics applied) is a function that returns a Promise whose value is void
 *                    In the case of using async/await, that amounts to these async functions that don't return anything. They are considered links in a chain.
 *                    They are resolved one at a time, and are each provided, at the very least, one Page from Puppeteer.
 * 
 *                    Now it's possible for a BotAction async function to return a value. But, to access that value, in the next BotAction, they must be ran inside a pipe()()
 *                    Only in a pipe()(), will the returned value of the last BotAction be injected at the end, wrapped in a Pipe object.
 * 
 *                 There are advanced BotAction's that support piping data, or have a more specific set of behavior like `injects` or return type.
 *                 These include ConditionalBotAction, BotFilesAction, and BotIndexedDBAction
